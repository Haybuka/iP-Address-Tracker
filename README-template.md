## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- leafletJs
- geoIpify


### What I learned

so while working on the project,i learnt how to use the leafletJs Map library, and also the Ip api.
I do intend to make a different clone of this site but using react js as that is my current focus.


I do wish to further my strangth in api usage and DOM rendering and also reading of documentation.
